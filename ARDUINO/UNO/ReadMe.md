# Snake Game Projects on Arduino Uno

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of the classic "Snake Game" built on the Arduino Uno platform. Each project demonstrates a unique configuration using different hardware components such as OLED displays, LED matrices, and button controls. The purpose is to provide a modular approach to building and customizing the Snake Game on Arduino Uno.
